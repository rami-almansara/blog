## ðŸ›  Key Tools  

- **Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas)** â€” for data analysis and scientific calculations.  
- **C/C++** â€” for high-performance computing.  
- **MATLAB / Octave** â€” for numerical methods and prototyping.  
- **Fortran** â€” a classic language for computational mathematics.  
- **R** â€” for statistics and data visualization.
