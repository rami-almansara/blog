## 📑 Why is formatting important?  

A well-formatted report reflects not only the depth of the research but also respect for the reader. Clear structure helps quickly grasp the main idea, while a neat style makes the text look professional.

## 🏗 Report Structure  

A typical report includes:  
1. **Title page**  
2. **Introduction** (objectives and goals of the work)  
3. **Main part** (description of the research or experiment)  
4. **Conclusion** (findings)  
5. **References**  
6. *(optional)* Appendices

## ✍ Text Formatting Rules  

- Use **clear headings** for sections and subsections.  
- Stick to a consistent **font and size** (usually Times New Roman, 12–14 pt).  
- Line spacing — 1.5, text justified.  
- Page numbers — required.  
- Tables and figures must have captions.

## 🛠 Tools  

- **MS Word / Google Docs** — convenient for basic formatting.  
- **LaTeX** — the standard for scientific reports, especially with formulas.  
- **Markdown + Pandoc** — a modern way to write text and export it to PDF, DOCX, and other formats.

## 🎯 Personal Experience  

I often prepare reports in **Markdown** and then convert them into PDF via Pandoc. This approach saves time: the text stays simple and readable, while the final document looks neat.

💡 A well-formatted report is half the success: it helps convey results clearly and makes the right impression.
