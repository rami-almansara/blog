## 📘 Why Do We Need Algorithms?  

An algorithm is a step-by-step instruction for solving a problem. The efficiency of an algorithm directly affects the program’s performance and resource usage.

## 🏗 Core Data Structures  

- **Arrays** — the basic way to store data.  
- **Lists** — a dynamic structure convenient for insertion and deletion.  
- **Stack** and **Queue** — classic structures for ordered data processing.  
- **Trees** and **Graphs** — for representing and processing complex relationships.  
- **Hash Tables** — for fast search operations.

## ⚡ Key Algorithms  

- **Sorting**: bubble sort, quicksort, merge sort.  
- **Search**: linear, binary.  
- **Graph algorithms**: depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra’s algorithm.  
- **Dynamic Programming** — a powerful tool for optimizing solutions.

## 🎯 Personal Experience  

I practice solving problems on **LeetCode** and **Codeforces**. This helps me better understand how to apply algorithms and data structures in real projects.
