## ✍ What is Markdown?  

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language used for text formatting. Its main advantage is simplicity: you can write plain text while adding minimal symbols to highlight headings, links, lists, or images.

## 🔧 Key Features  

- **Headings**: `#`, `##`, `###`  
- **Text formatting**: `*italic*`, `**bold**`  
- **Lists**:  
  - unordered (`-`, `*`)  
  - ordered (`1.`, `2.`)  
- **Links**: `[Text](https://example.com)`  
- **Images**: `![Description](image.png)`  
- **Code**:  
  - inline — `` `code` ``  
  - block — triple backticks \`\`\`

## 📘 Where is it used?  

- Project documentation  
- GitHub README files  
- Blogs and notes  
- Study materials and lecture notes  
- Post formatting in systems like Hugo or Jekyll

## 🎯 Personal Experience  

Markdown has become a universal tool for me:  
- I write **notes and blog posts** in it.  
- I use it in **GitHub README** files to structure project descriptions.  
- I’ve mastered extensions such as tables and checklists.

💡 Markdown is minimalism and convenience: once you learn it, you can easily write readable text that renders beautifully on the web.
