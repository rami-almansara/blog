## 🚀 New Project  

This week I started working on building a **personal academic website** using the **Hugo Academic** theme.  

### 🔧 What I did:  
- Installed **Hugo** and the Academic theme.  
- Configured the site structure: “About Me”, “Publications”, “Projects”, “Blog”.  
- Added basic information: education, interests, and profiles (GitHub, ORCID, ResearchGate, etc.).  
- Figured out how the tagging and categorization system works.  

### 📘 What I learned:  
- Mastered the basics of writing posts in **Markdown**.  
- Learned how to customize the design using **YAML configs**.  
- Discovered the possibility of automatic publication lists generation via BibTeX.  

### 🎯 Next steps:  
- Add a section with scientific papers and projects.  
- Set up multilingual support (RU/EN).  
- Connect Google Analytics for statistics.

💡 This project will help create an **academic portfolio** and maintain a blog about my studies and research.
